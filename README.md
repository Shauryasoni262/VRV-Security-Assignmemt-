## **Description**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI in React is a secure and intuitive interface designed for managing user roles and permissions. It provides a login and registration system, allowing users to select their roles during registration. Based on the assigned roles, the UI controls access to different sections of the website, with admins having full access to manage users and roles, while managers have limited administrative access. This system ensures efficient role management and secure access to resources based on user permissions.
