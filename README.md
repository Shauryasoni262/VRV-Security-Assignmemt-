## **Description**

The idea is simple: prevent the app from generating unnecessary routes by checking the current user role on each route. Rather than checking the role for every route, we generate only the routes that the user has access to.

---

## **Benefits**

- **Check route access only once**: Route access is checked when the parent route renders.
- **Generate only accessible routes**: The app dynamically generates only the routes that the user has access to.
- **Centralized roles and private routes configuration**: A single file to manage all role and route configurations.
- **Ease of role management**: Adding/removing roles and route access is simplified.
- **Synchronization between routes and navigation**: Ensures that the navigation menu reflects only available routes for the current user role.
- **Single & Multiple role support**: Support for users with multiple roles or a single role.

---

## **TODO**

- Design the same approach for handling components based on role-based access.
